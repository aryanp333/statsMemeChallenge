# 🎨 Selection Bias & Missing Data Challenge - Part 2

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Challenge Requirements

**Your Task:** Create a four-panel statistics meme demonstrating selection bias using your original image and stippled version from [Part 1](https://flyaflya.github.io/stippleChallenge/).

**Prerequisites:** Completed [Part 1](https://flyaflya.github.io/stippleChallenge/) with:

1. Your original image file
2. Your stippled image (numpy array or R matrix)
3. Image dimensions (height and width)

**Deliverables:**

1. Four-panel meme (1×4 or 2×2 layout) with labels: Reality, Your Model, Selection Bias, Estimate
2. Code (Python or R) that generates the meme
3. GitHub Pages site named "statsMemeChallenge" with your meme and explanation

**Repository Information:**

- **Source/Starter File:** Available in the main repository at [https://github.com/flyaflya/statsMemeChallenge](https://github.com/flyaflya/statsMemeChallenge)
- **Challenge Read Online:** View the challenge instructions at [https://flyaflya.github.io/statsMemeChallenge](https://flyaflya.github.io/statsMemeChallenge)

## The Problem: Visualizing Selection Bias

Selection bias occurs when observed data isn't representative of the population. Your meme will show:

- **Reality**: Your original image (truth)
- **Your Model**: Your stippled image (representation)
- **Selection Bias**: A bold letter "S" (systematic missing data pattern)
- **Estimate**: Stippled image with "S" mask applied (biased estimate)

**Key Concept:** Images are simply matrices—2D arrays where each value represents a pixel (0.0 = black, 1.0 = white). Your stippled image is a matrix with black dots (data points) on a white background. Selection bias removes some of these pixels (data points) in a systematic pattern (the "S"), creating a biased estimate. You'll use image composition tools (matplotlib in Python, imager in R) to arrange these matrices into a memorable visualization.

## Exemplar

![Exemplar statistics meme showing the four-panel structure: Reality (original image), Your Model (stippled version), Selection Bias (letter S), and Estimate (masked stippled image)](statistics_meme.png)

**Your Goal:** Recreate this structure using **your own** original and stippled images from [Part 1](https://flyaflya.github.io/stippleChallenge/).

## Why This Matters

This exercise is fundamentally about **walking AI through a process** to create valuable output. You're not just coding—you're collaborating with AI to transform abstract statistical concepts into a memorable visual artifact. The meme you create will serve as a mental anchor: whenever you think about selection bias in the future, you'll ask yourself: **"Does my sample match my population of interest?"** This visualization will stick with you for the rest of your life, making it easier to recognize and address selection bias in real-world data analysis.

## The Statistics Meme

The four-panel statistics meme has been generated, demonstrating selection bias through visualization:

![Four-panel statistics meme showing Reality (original image), Your Model (stippled version), Selection Bias (letter S), and Estimate (masked stippled image)](statistics_meme_result.png)

**Note:** The meme was generated using the code below (hidden in the final HTML output). To regenerate the meme, you can run:
```bash
python3 generate_meme.py
```

The following code generates the four-panel statistics meme demonstrating selection bias. The code loads your original and stippled images from Part 1, creates a bold letter "S" to represent selection bias, applies it as a mask to the stippled image, and assembles everything into a professional visualization.

## Understanding Selection Bias Through Visualization

This four-panel meme demonstrates the concept of **selection bias** in statistics:

1. **Reality** (Panel 1): This represents the true population—your original image. This is the complete, unbiased truth we're trying to understand.

2. **Your Model** (Panel 2): This is your stippled representation—a model of reality created through systematic sampling (blue noise stippling). The black dots represent your data points, and while they capture the essential structure, they're a simplified representation.

3. **Selection Bias** (Panel 3): The bold letter "S" represents a systematic pattern of missing data. In real-world scenarios, selection bias occurs when certain groups or regions are systematically excluded from your sample. Here, the "S" shape shows where data would be missing.

4. **Estimate** (Panel 4): This is what you'd see if selection bias affected your model. Notice how the "S"-shaped region has no data points—the stipples have been removed. This biased sample would lead to incorrect conclusions because it doesn't represent the full population.

**The Key Insight:** When selection bias occurs, your sample (the stippled dots) doesn't match your population of interest (the original image). The missing data in the "S" shape creates a distorted view of reality, just like how biased sampling in research can lead to incorrect statistical conclusions.

This visualization serves as a mental anchor: whenever you encounter data analysis, ask yourself: **"Does my sample match my population of interest?"** If not, you may be dealing with selection bias that could invalidate your results.

## Tips for Success

1. **Font Selection**: Use bold fonts (Arial Bold, DejaVu Sans Bold) for the "S"
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust `threshold` (typically 0.5) for clean mask edges
3. **Spacing**: Minimize gaps between panels (`wspace=0`, `hspace=0`)
4. **Background**: Light pink background helps panels stand out
5. **Save Quality**: Use DPI 150-300 for crisp output
6. **Layout Choice**: 1×4 for wide images, 2×2 for square/tall images

## Submission Requirements

**Important:** Your final GitHub Pages site should be a clean, professional presentation that focuses on the meme and explanation, not the code.

- [ ] The HTML should display **only the four-panel meme image**
- [ ] Include a **brief explanation** of selection bias and how your meme demonstrates it
- [ ] Professional, clean presentation suitable for sharing

**Submission Checklist:**

- [ ] All four panels: Reality, Your Model, Selection Bias, Estimate
- [ ] Clear labels on each panel
- [ ] Bold, properly-sized "S" letter
- [ ] Masked estimate correctly removes stipples within "S"
- [ ] Clean layout with minimal spacing
- [ ] Code runs without errors and generates the meme
- [ ] `index.qmd` file in repository with `echo: false` for meme generation code
- [ ] Supporting code files (if any) included in repository
- [ ] Document rendered to HTML successfully (meme generated, code hidden)
- [ ] HTML files uploaded to your repository
- [ ] GitHub Pages enabled and working
- [ ] Site accessible at `https://[your-username].github.io/statsMemeChallenge/`
- [ ] Final site shows only the meme and explanation (no visible code)
- [ ] Brief explanation of selection bias included in HTML

**Remember:** Create a memorable, educational visualization that helps others understand selection bias. This is about more than completing an assignment—it's about building a lasting understanding through creative collaboration with AI.
